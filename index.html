	<h1>Oriol J. Bosch</h1>
	<p>
I am a PhD student at the Department of Methodology at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and a Researcher at the Research and Expertise Centre for Survey Methodology (RECSM). 

I hold a BA in Political Science from Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) and an MSc in Survey Methods for Social Research from the University of Essex. Previously I worked as a Research Officer at the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex.

My main research topics are currently: survey methodology, data quality, web surveys, mobile devices and the use of new data types (e.g. images, Big Data and passive measurements) for survey research. In substantive fields, I am also interested in political behaviour, polarization and Fake News.

For my PhD, I am developing a framework for combining online behavioural data and survey data. Besides, I will apply this framework to study echo chambers and the effect of Fake News on political attitudes and behaviours.
